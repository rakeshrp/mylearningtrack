If a SQL statement is written so that it performs unnecessary work, then the optimizer cannot do much to improve its performance. Examples of inefficient design include

    Neglecting to add a join condition, which leads to a Cartesian join

    Using hints to specify a large table as the driving table in a join

    Specifying UNION instead of UNION ALL

    Making a subquery execute for every row in an outer query


selectivity (between 0 and 1)

A value indicating the proportion of a row set retrieved by a predicate or combination of predicates, for example, WHERE last_name = 'Smith'. A selectivity of 0 means that no rows pass the predicate test, whereas a value of 1 means that all rows pass the test.

The adjective selective means roughly "choosy." Thus, a highly selective query returns a low proportion of rows (selectivity close to 0), whereas an unselective query returns a high proportion of rows (selectivity close to 1).
