If a SQL statement is written so that it performs unnecessary work, then the optimizer cannot do much to improve its performance. Examples of inefficient design include

    Neglecting to add a join condition, which leads to a Cartesian join

    Using hints to specify a large table as the driving table in a join

    Specifying UNION instead of UNION ALL

    Making a subquery execute for every row in an outer query
